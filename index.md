## The osu! Tournament Mappool Project

The purpose of this project is to give players, competitive or not, easy access to Tournament Mappools to enjoy and/or practice on. The project started with me wanting to have all of the OWC Mappools available to play quickly since playing them always gave me a kick of nostalgia. Later I used these for general practice. My aim is to make these pools and others available to the community to improve or find that nostalgic feeling that makes you enjoy the game even more.

### How to use the collections you download

These Collections are made for [piotrekol's Collection Manager](https://github.com/piotrekol/CollectionManager). To install them to your osu! simply:
1. Install the Collection Manager
2. Download one of the Collections (.osdb files)
3. Open the Collection Manager
4. Click File > Open > osu! Collection (to retain your old collections)
5. Drag the Collection you downloaded into the Collections window on the left
6. If you're missing maps (shows up in the top-right): Online > Download all missing maps
7. Click on File > Save > osu! Collection
8. And you're done!
